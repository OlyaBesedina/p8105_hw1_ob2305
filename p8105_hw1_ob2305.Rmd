# Problem 1

```{r problem 1}

my_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("monkey", "eel", "finch", "dog", "cat", "salmon", "carp","parrot"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("mammal", "fish", "bird", "mammal", "mammal", "fish", "fish", "bird"))
)

# The mean of the variables inside the data frame
mean(pull(my_df, vec_numeric))
mean(pull(my_df, vec_logical))
mean(pull(my_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(my_df, vec_factor))

# You can only take a mean of numeric or logical vectors, thus mean(vec_char) and mean(vec_factor) are not applicable.

## Application of as.numeric

# logical vector
l = pull(my_df, vec_logical)
as.numeric(l)

# character vector
c = pull(my_df, vec_char)
as.numeric(c)

# factor vector
f = pull(my_df, vec_factor)
as.numeric(f)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}

# Problem 2

```{r problem 2}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  logic_vector = x + y >1
)

```
